					<p>A manuscript is a handwritten composition on paper, bark,
											cloth, metal, palm leaf or any other material dating back at least seventyfive
											years that has significant scientific, historical or aesthetic value.
											Lithographs and printed volumes are not manuscripts. Manuscripts are
											found in hundreds of different languages and scripts. O􀁍en, one language
											is written in a number of different scripts. For example, Sanskrit is written
											in Oriya script, Grantha script, Devanagari script and many other scripts.
											<a href="http://namami.nic.in" target="_blank"> (http://namami.nic.in).</a>
											Manuscripts are distinct from historical records such as epigraphs on
											rocks, firmans, revenue records which provide direct information on
											events or processes in history. Manuscripts have knowledge content. It is
											pertinent to note that there is a treasure house of Indian Traditional
											Knowledge systems viz., Ayurveda, Vrikshayurveda, Ashvayurveda,
											Gajayurveda, Siddha, Yoga, Dhanurveda, Sangita, Natya, Sthapatyaveda,
											Shilpashastra etc., in millions of manuscripts in private collections or in
											Intuitional repositories across length and breadth of India. Government
											of India through NAMAMI (National Manuscript Mission) and Ministry of
											AYUSH through Central Scheme “Acquisition, Cataloging, Digitization and
											Publication of Text Book &amp; Manuscripts of Ayush” are working relentlessly
											to bring out this treasure to the utility of common people. As part of the
											same drive AMAR has been created.</p>

					<p><b> “AMAR”</b> is developed by National Centre of Indian Medical
												Heritage, Hyderabad working under the Central Council for Research in
												Ayurvedic Sciences, Ministry of AYUSH, and Government of India. It is a
												unique and dedicated institute for preservation and showcasing of
												“Indian Medical Heritage” in its all possible forms viz., Archeological
												artifacts, Manuscripts, Textual studies, Ethnomedical/botanical
												practices and any other source deemed fit. As part of the mandate of the
												Institute, it has worked extensively on collection, digitization and
												cataloguing Manuscripts of Medical importance specially related with
												Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, Yog&amp;Naturopahty. In between 2009-13 the
												institute has carried out extensive field work under ““Acquisition,
												Cataloging, Digitization and Publication of Text Book &amp; Manuscripts of
												Ayush” sponsored by Ministry of AYUSH (then Dept. of AYUSH) and
												successfully digitized manuscripts. The outcome of the work was
												published as “Descriptive Catalogue of Collection and Digitization of
												Medical Manuscripts from South India, Maharashtra and Madhyapradesh
												(2013). Similarly a project entitled “Survey, cataloging and Digitized
												inventory of Medical Manuscripts in Eastern India (Orissa, West Bengal &amp;
												Bihar” which was carried out by CCRAS Hqrs., and National Research
												Institute of Ayurvedic Drug Development, Bhubaneshwar. The outcome of
												the work was published as “Descriptive Catalogue of Medical Manuscripts
												(3 volumes) in the year 2010-11. However due to sheer size of these
												catalogues it was envisaged to bring out the information in digital
												catalogue format so that more number of users can access the same. The
												result is development of AYUSH Medical Advanced Repository (AMAR).</p>
					<p>AMAR is immensely useful for the
													scholars of Basic Principles, Classical
													textual based specializations of AYUSH
													(e.g. Samhita Siddha for Ayurveda),
													Scholars of Indology, South Asian
													Studies, Medial Historians, Language
													experts and other enthusiasts who share
													passion of traditional knowledge.  AMAR can be access at: <a href="http://niimh.nic.in/amar" target="_blank">http://niimh.nic.in/amar</a></p>
